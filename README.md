FinBERT-based S&P 500 Volatility Forecasting

This project uses daily news headlines and FinBERT embeddings to predict 30-day forward volatility of the S&P 500 index. It demonstrates the feasibility and challenges of using language models for financial time-series forecasting.

🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes:

Date and headline (2008–2024)

S&P 500 closing price per day

Computed 30-day forward volatility

384-dimensional FinBERT embeddings (sentence-transformers)

🔧 Methodology

Preprocessing:

Dropped rows with missing volatility

Extracted FinBERT embeddings as input features

Target: 30-day forward volatility (log-return-based)

Train-Test Split:

80% training, 20% testing using train_test_split

Modeling:

Trained 4 models on the headline embeddings:

Random Forest

XGBoost

LightGBM

CatBoost

Evaluated on R² Score, MAE, and RMSE

📊 Model Comparison
Model	R² Score	MAE	RMSE
Random Forest	0.0568	0.0024	0.0041
XGBoost	0.0774	0.0024	0.0041
LightGBM	0.0826	0.0024	0.0041
CatBoost	0.0320	0.0024	0.0042

📌 LightGBM was chosen for deployment due to its slightly superior R².

🚀 Gradio Interface

A simple Gradio demo allows users to input a news headline and get the model’s predicted 30-day volatility.

Headline: "Apple beats earnings expectations, shares surge"
Prediction: 0.0041 (Volatility)
